My name is Kyojuro, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Digital Anti-Aging Healthcare at Inje University, South Korea. I began my program in September 2024 with a focus on applying AI technologies to preventive care, digital wellness, and smart aging systems.

I am originally from Battambang province in Cambodia. I came to South Korea through the Global Korea Scholarship (GKS) program. My academic interests lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence, digital healthcare platforms, and aging-related innovations.

My specialization includes:
- Computer vision for facial analysis and personal color detection
- Multimodal AI for health-related diagnostics and smart applications
- Reinforcement learning in mental wellness support systems
- Real-time health tracking using AI-generated feedback loops

Beyond academics, I enjoy:
- Learning Korean (currently at TOPIK Level 3, aiming for Level 5)
- Exploring Korean cities and culture during weekends
- Cooking easy but healthy meals, often inspired by Korean convenience foods
- Drawing digitally as a relaxing offline activity
- Editing short videos for future content on YouTube

My typical day starts with prayer and quiet reflection, followed by a bodyweight workout. Mornings are usually for focused study, afternoons for coding or research, and evenings for reading or video editing.

My short- and long-term goals include:
- Publishing a research paper on AI-based wellness tools
- Becoming fluent in Korean for both daily life and research work
- Launching a YouTube channel documenting my life, studies, and tech projects in Korea
- Designing a mobile app that supports daily anti-aging habits and monitoring

I place strong emphasis on ethics, time management, and building meaningful systems. I aim to develop AI that is not only technically strong but also practical and respectful to real human lives.

If there's one principle that guides my life, it's this: to combine purpose, simplicity, and technology to improve how we live and age.

I try to maintain a structured yet flexible daily routine to balance productivity, wellness, and spiritual growth.

Morning:
- Wake up early, usually around 6:30 AM.
- Begin the day with prayer, meditation, or spiritual reflection.
- Perform a bodyweight workout or stretching routine (no gym needed).
- Eat a simple, healthy breakfast and review daily goals or to-do list.

Afternoon:
- Attend classes or work on assignments and projects related to digital healthcare and AI.
- Focus on coding, research, or writing thesis content.
- Occasionally take walks or visit quiet study spots around campus.

Evening:
- Prepare or buy a simple dinner (sometimes trying new Korean foods).
- Review Korean vocabulary or TOPIK prep materials.
- Spend time reading, watching inspiring or educational content.
- Edit videos for future content creation.

Before sleep:
- Reflect on the day, reset tasks for tomorrow, and pray before rest.

My goals span both personal and academic areas.

In the short term, I aim to:
- Complete my Master's thesis focused on AI applications in digital anti-aging healthcare.
- Reach TOPIK Level 5 proficiency in Korean to improve academic and everyday communication.
- Develop and release a mobile app that supports daily wellness and anti-aging habits.
- Launch a YouTube channel that documents my student life in Korea, digital productivity tips, and personal growth.

Long-term goals include:
- Becoming a recognized developer and researcher in the field of digital health and smart aging systems.
- Building a platform that integrates AI, behavioral science, and lifestyle data to support aging populations.
- Promoting ethical and responsible AI use in healthcare settings.
- Mentoring others from Cambodia or similar backgrounds who want to study and thrive abroad through digital innovation.
